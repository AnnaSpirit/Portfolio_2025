# EXERCICE: Instructions

		# In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
		# It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
		# For example, with a left shift of 3 â€“> D would be replaced by A,
		# â€“> E would become B, and so on.
		# The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
		# Create a python program that encrypts and decrypts messages with ceasar cypher.
		# The user enters the program, and then the program asks him if he wants to encrypt or decrypt, and then execute encryption/decryption on a given message and a given shift.

		# Hint:
		# for letter in text:
		# 	cypher_text += chr(ord(letter) + 3)

# QUESTION: With the Link the shift is -3, (a to x) ðŸ¤” 
# PROF: += alphabet[(letterindex + 3)%26]
# NOTE: I have to change the shift to -3, and the modulo to 25, because the alphabet list is 26 characters long, and the modulo operator is 25 because the index starts at 0.
